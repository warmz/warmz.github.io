## A smart electric blanket or mattress pad that helps you sleep cozy at night.

By integrating smart home technologies, network connectivity, and biometric feedback, WarmZ allows customers to tailor bedtime routines and temperatures for their best sleep.

According to numerous studies, over half of all Americans are unhappy with the quality and quantity of their sleep. While there are many factors in getting a good night sleep, temperature throughout the night is a critical factor in restlessness, delays in falling asleep, and how much time is spent in REM and deep sleep throughout the night.

“I love being able to say ‘Alexa, warm up my bed’ as I’m putting my kids to bed”, said Julie Collins, a 30-something stay-at-home mom from Michigan. “By the time the kids are in bed, my bed is toasty and warm. I don’t get too warm at night though because WarmZ monitors my temperature and adjusts it throughout the night so that I stay at the optimum temperature range for rest and recovery.”

“I am thankful to WarmZ because it protects me from my wife’s cold feet”, says Greg Carlson, a devoted husband of 34 years. “My wife used to get in to bed every night with ice cold feet and would warm them on me. Now she uses WarmZ to set the foot area to extra warm and her feet thaw out quickly without discomfort to me.”

Electric blankets have not changed much since the 1970’s. WarmZ updates the classic with smart home integration, voice activation, control and monitoring of temperature instead of simple settings that can be too hot and too cold in the same night, adjustment of t


## FAQ 

1. What is the WarmZ north star?

  _Modern technologies applied to an electric blanket that are simple and easy to use and delight the customer._

2. What is the target market for WarmZ?

  _The target market is 30+ couples who have the necessities of life and are filling wants. They have a queen, king, or cal king bed.

They are not necessarily tech savvy but are looking for comfort, reliability, and value._

3. Why doesn’t WarmZ have bed-side controls?

  _Bed-side controls add cost, increase complexity of setup, and reduce system reliability. The functionality of the bed-side controller can be replaced by a phone app and voice controls. This decision may limit our target market a bit but will reduce costs and simplify setup, guides, troubleshooting, and customer support calls._

4. What are the WarmZ configurations?

  _WarmZ takes the place of a mattress pad. It has individually controllable temperature areas for body and feet. WarmZ also supports left and right temperature areas. The base unit sits under the head of the bed and contains all of the electronics and power supplies. A single cord connects the pad to the base unit._

5. What’s next for WarmZ?
 - _Sleep research can be applied to guide users to select optimal nighttime temperature profiles after the initial warm-up temperature when they first get into bed._
- _WarmZ could learn the users bedtime and start to warm up the bed automatically based on the ambient temperature sensor (don't warm the bed on a hot night)._
- _The base unit under the bed will include an ambient temperature sensor which could be used to adjust blanket temperature based on ambient._
- _An accelerometer will be included but not used in the initial release. With the appropriate ML models, the accelerometer could be used to measure breathing, heart rate, and restlessness. Based on cues from the measured biometrics, temperature could be adjusted to maximize deep and REM sleep._
- _We could do a WarmZ blanket and/or snuggie._
- _We could do a WarmZ targeting the office worker that looks good in that setting and has a PC app to control it._
